## AngularJS: Get Started

AngularJS is a complete JavaScript framework for creating dynamic and interactive applications in HTML. This course is designed to cover the core features of the framework using practical, easy to follow examples. We will see how two-way data binding makes it easy to build pages and forms while maintaining simplicity in the JavaScript code, and come to understand the essential abstractions of AngularJS, including modules, controllers, directives, and services. By the end of the course, you'll be able to start building your own single page application using AngularJS.
